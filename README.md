Sooooo... I am taking a leap here, hear me out.

Welcome to my first portfolio website! 
This is a project created mainly to learn, new to me, yet common tech that is used on in the software development industry. I wanted to challenge myself in learning tailwind and framer motion so that I can become a better engineer, while also creating a valuable asset to expand my visablity to employeers. This is a very basic site though I found it pretty challenging to work with through the creative droughts that took place from time to time. I have realized in the making of this that i really miss working on backend technology, even though I found this fight to be very useful in my break-through into software engineering.

#FrontEnd
