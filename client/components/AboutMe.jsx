        Prior to my pivot into the tech industry I was immersed in the ups and
        down of being a retail/warehouse manager. After bumping my head, going
        full speed trying to make a living by climbing ladders, I took a hard
        look back and saw titles may have changed but my impact remained the
        same. Taking the my internal conflict of not making a difference on a
        macro level, I made the calculated leap of faith into the career of my
        dreams! I have now graduated from my web development boot camp. I seek a
        path to create technologies that will impact and advance the human
        experience on this floating rock we all share.
