<h1>AboutMe</h1>
<h3>Prior to my pivot into the tech industry I was immersed in the ups and down of being a retail/warehouse manager. After bumping my head, going full speed trying to make a living by climbing ladders, I took a hard look back and saw titles may have changed but my impact remained the same. Taking the my internal conflict of not making a difference on a macro level, I made the calculated leap of faith into the career of my dreams! I have now graduated my web development boot camp. I seek a path to create technologies that will impact and advance the human experience on this floating rock we all share.</h3>
