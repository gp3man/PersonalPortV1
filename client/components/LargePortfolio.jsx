I plan to add more features such as the search option, as well as a karaoke tab so that you can sing your heart out with friends and family. Login with Spotify.",

        "An e-commerce website made for big and tall individuals. To browse application, use (USR: admin, PWD: 123). This was created alongside @justinpsiegel @Rhyan9311 @soloweshop243. We worked as a team to create a mock website that allows you to purchase clothing from our store. Though, the styling is wacky, we did a lot of heavy lifting in terms of creating the correct and proper database schema that will serve to the frontend react app. We plan on expanding on this app by fixing the styling, adding more items, and giving admin users extra controls over the database.",

We worked towards making our own creation of a game that anyone can enjoy. We plan to expand by creating more levels/maps, as well as adding more incentives to continue playing the game. This was a huge learning curve but it was definitely an eye opener to what it truly takes to create high quality game.",
